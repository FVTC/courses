# Getting Started

To use FVTC.Software, you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. You can create on free by visiting [github.com/join](github.com/join).

After logging in, fork the [Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/fvtc/tutorials) by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page.

On the next screen, you can rename the repository if you want. Or, just use the default `courses`.

This will create a copy of the repository in your account. You can now edit the files in the repository and commit your changes.

# Editing Files

You can edit files right inside of github. To do so, navigate to the page that you would like to edit and click on the "Edit" button.
