# Introduction

This guide will help you get started with the [FVTC.Software](https://fvtc.software) platform.

## What is FVTC.Software?

FVTC.Software is a platform for hosting and managing course materials for Fox Valley Technical College's IT Programs. It is built on top of [GitHub](https://github.com) and uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for content generation.

Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to write content in plain text and have it converted to HTML. It is used by many popular websites, including [GitHub](https://github.com), [Reddit](https://reddit.com), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

You can see the source code for this page [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FVTC/fvtc.software/master/docs/software/getting-started.md).
