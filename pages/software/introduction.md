# What is FVTC.Software?

FVTC.Software is a platform for hosting and managing course materials for Fox Valley Technical College's IT Programs.

It is built on top of [GitHub](https://github.com) and uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for content generation.

Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to write content in plain text and have it converted to HTML.

You can see the source code for this page [here](https://github.com/FVTC/courses/blob/master/pages/software/introduction.md?plain=true).
