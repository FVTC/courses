# Exam 1 - Practical

For this exam you will write a program that will perform some basic arithmetic operations. The program will read two numbers from the user and then perform either addition or subtraction on the two numbers. The user will be able to choose which operation to perform. The program will then display the result of the operation.

Example output:

<div class="no-copy">

```plaintext
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Choose an operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction): 1

The result of 10 + 5 is 15
```

</div>

<div class="no-copy">

If the user chooses an invalid operation, the program should prompt the user again.

Example output:

```plaintext
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Choose an operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction): 3
Choose an operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction): 2

The result of 10 - 5 is 5
```

</div>

Your program should contain the following functions:

1. `GetFirstNumber` - This function will prompt the user for a number and return the number entered by the user.

2. `GetSecondNumber` - This function will prompt the user for a number and return the number entered by the user.

3. `GetOperation` - This function will prompt the user for an operation and return the operation entered by the user. The function should keep prompting the user until a valid operation is entered.

4. `DisplayAddition` - This function will take two numbers as arguments and display the result of adding the two numbers.

5. `DisplaySubtraction` - This function will take two numbers as arguments and display the result of subtracting the second number from the first number.

> [!IMPORTANT] Do not use global variables. All variables should be passed as arguments to functions.

# Submission
